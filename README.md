- Codebase for our paper Lossy Image Compression with Conditional Diffusion Models
- Model weights are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/197Wl5cwjaCvrEvggMcyNeHOSxq2rDZ1F?usp=sharing)
- You may need to write your own testing/training code and import our model. We attach our testing/training code for reference.
- Please revert to commit ["742de7f50eb18e5293d69461dd97db664cbd499b"](https://github.com/buggyyang/CDC_compression/commit/742de7f50eb18e5293d69461dd97db664cbd499b) if current code does not work well.
